# ACA2022

Slides to talk on 1 August 2022 at the American Crystallographic Association. The talk was using using snippet libraries in Colab notebooks. The end of the talk included the use of Neovim and other editors to code cells via GhostText; this might be the most widely useful take-away from this talk.
