# Easing script writing in Google Colab with structural biology snippets


Slides from talk on 1 August 2022 at the 72nd Annual Meeting of the American Crystallographic Association: the Structural Sciences Society. 
The talk was using using snippet libraries in Colab notebooks. 
The end of the talk included the use of Neovim and other editors to code cells via GhostText; this might be the most widely useful take-away from this talk.

The abstract has been published. A peer-reviewed paper is in preparation.
